# openwrt-mcp

An MCP server that runs **on** an OpenWrt router, so Claude Code (or any MCP client) can
inspect and change it over an SSH tunnel.

The other OpenWrt MCP servers I could find run *off*-router — they SSH in from your
workstation on every call. This one is resident: a single static Go binary under procd,
always on, with its own authorisation and audit trail.

It exposes six generic tools rather than a hand-written catalogue of router features.
`ubus list -v` already self-describes every object, method and argument signature on the
box, so the agent discovers what your router can actually do instead of trusting a list
that goes stale with each firmware update. On a GL.iNet box that means the vendor's own
`gl-*` objects come through without a line of code per feature.

---

## Use cases

### 1. Putting a new router through its paces

The one this was written for. Ask in plain language and let the agent find the objects:

> "What's on the 6GHz radio right now, and how much airtime is each client using?"

The agent calls `ubus_list` to see what's available (`iwinfo`, `network.wireless`,
`luci-rpc`, `gl-clients` …), then `ubus_call` to read them. A read-only grant covers this
and cannot change anything:

```sh
openwrt-mcp allow claude-code ubus_call,logread 'network.* iwinfo.* luci-rpc.* gl-*' 30d
```

### 2. "The wifi has been dropping out"

Correlating a symptom across sources is tedious by hand and well suited to an agent:
association lists, survey/scan data, DHCP lease churn and the system log, over the same
window. Still a read-only grant — worth having standing, since it can't break anything.

> "Cross-reference the last hour of logs against which clients disconnected, and tell me
> whether it correlates with a channel change or a DFS event."

### 3. Config changes with an undo you don't have to remember

The interesting one. `uci_apply` stages your changes, snapshots the configs it's touching,
commits, reloads — and **arms a rollback timer**. If `uci_confirm` isn't called before it
expires, the router puts everything back. Lock yourself out with a bad firewall rule and it
repairs itself while you're still typing.

```
uci_apply  {"changes": [{"config":"firewall","section":"@zone[1]","option":"input","value":"DROP"}],
            "timeout": 120}
  -> "ROLLBACK ARMED: reverts at 15:07:22Z (in 2m0s) unless you call uci_confirm {...}"

  ... you check you can still reach the router ...

uci_confirm {"token": "3Kc681oIe4IP"}
  -> "Confirmed. Rollback cancelled."
```

If the daemon is restarted mid-window the change is rolled back on startup, because nobody
ever vouched for it.

### 4. An audit trail for what the agent did

Every tool call is recorded at the wrapper, so a new tool is logged without opting in.
`DENIED` is a distinct outcome from `ERROR` — "we said no" isn't "it broke":

```
OK      uci_apply    system.@system[0].description   applied 1 change(s), rollback armed 20s
OK      uci_rollback -                               rolled back system (timeout)
DENIED  uci_apply    system.@system[0].description   denied: no policy grants uci_apply to "confirm-test"
OK      uci_confirm  -                               confirmed m2_glAwWSd5L
```

Secrets are redacted by the recorder rather than by callers, so a new tool can't leak a
password by forgetting to scrub it. `keyId` and `publicKey` deliberately survive — they're
identifiers, and redacting them would make the log useless.

## Install

```sh
make install ROUTER=root@192.168.8.1
```

Then pair a client and grant it something:

```sh
ssh root@192.168.8.1 'openwrt-mcp pair claude-code'      # prints the token ONCE
ssh root@192.168.8.1 "openwrt-mcp allow claude-code ubus_call,logread 'network.* iwinfo.*' 30d"
```

Connect over a tunnel — the daemon refuses to bind anything but loopback:

```sh
ssh -N -f -L 8730:127.0.0.1:8730 root@192.168.8.1
claude mcp add --transport http openwrt http://127.0.0.1:8730/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOK"
```

> OpenWrt's dropbear has no `sftp-server`, so plain `scp` fails with "Connection closed".
> The Makefile pipes over ssh instead; use `scp -O` if you're copying files by hand.

## Security model

Adapted from [Haven](https://github.com/GlassOnTin/Haven)'s MCP backbone.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Reachability** | Loopback only, enforced in code — startup fails on a routable address. SSH key auth is the outer lock, the bearer token the inner one. |
| **No loopback auto-trust** | Any process on the router can reach `127.0.0.1`, and `ssh -R` can make remote traffic arrive there. Reachability is never treated as identity; origin is recorded for attribution only. |
| **Tokens** | 256-bit, base64url, shown once. Only the SHA-256 digest is stored (mode 0600), compared in constant time. `unpair` takes effect without a restart. |
| **Authorisation** | Standing policies in `/etc/config/openwrt-mcp`. Deny by default. A policy grants a client a tool list, scope globs, a calls/minute ceiling and an expiry — and can only ever *add* permission. |
| **Refusals are actionable** | A denial names the uncovered scope and prints the `openwrt-mcp allow …` line that would grant it. |
| **Grant management is CLI-only** | `pair`/`allow`/`unpair` are not MCP tools, so there's no tool for a policy to cover and no self-escalation path through the policy system. |
| **Rollback** | `uci_apply` reverts unless confirmed, including across a daemon restart. |

`ubus_list` is the one ungated tool: introspection returns method names and argument types,
never configuration data, and without it an agent can't discover what to ask for.

### Why not rpcd's ACLs or its own apply/rollback?

Both were the first choice; neither works for a resident daemon.

- **rpcd ACLs don't apply.** A root process calling ubus over the local unix socket bypasses
  them entirely — sessionless `uci get` returns data. ACLs only bind the uhttpd JSON-RPC
  path. Relying on them here would be theatre.
- **rpcd's `uci apply {"rollback":true}` needs credentials.** Every uci *write* method takes
  a `ubus_rpc_session`, and `session.login` wants a username and password. Verified on
  OpenWrt 21.02 / rpcd 2022-02-19:

  ```
  ubus call uci apply '{}'                          -> Invalid argument   (no session)
  ubus call uci apply '{"ubus_rpc_session":"0..0"}' -> No response        (null session, no write ACL)
  ```

  Storing the router's root password in a file on the router is a worse hole than the one
  the rollback closes, so `uci_apply` snapshots and restores itself.

## Tools

| Tool | Policy scope | |
|---|---|---|
| `ubus_list` | *(ungated)* | Objects, methods and argument signatures. The discovery tool. |
| `ubus_call` | `<object>.<method>` | The workhorse: netifd, wireless, dnsmasq, iwinfo, luci-rpc, `gl-*`. |
| `uci_apply` | `<config>.<section>.<option>` per change | Stage → snapshot → commit → reload, rollback armed. All scopes must be covered by one policy. |
| `uci_confirm` | *(tool-level)* | Cancels the rollback timer. |
| `exec` | `argv[0]` | Direct exec, **no shell** — no pipes, globs or redirection, and no quoting surface. |
| `logread` | *(tool-level)* | Split out from `exec` so logs can be granted without a root shell. |

## Status

Written against a GL.iNet **Flint 2** (OpenWrt 21.02-SNAPSHOT, kernel 5.4, aarch64), ahead
of a **Flint 4** (GL-BE14000, MT7988A, 2GB/64GB).

**Verified on hardware:** bearer auth (401 on missing/wrong, 200 on valid, both audited);
revocation taking effect without a restart; the scope gate refusing an out-of-scope object;
rollback-on-timeout restoring `/etc/config/system` byte-identically against an independent
backup; confirm cancelling the timer (value survived 20s past a 15s deadline); per-client
policy isolation; and the whole path over a real `ssh -L` tunnel.

21 unit tests pass. They're mutation-checked: neutering `Authorise` fails 5 of them,
neutering `redact` fails 2.

**Not verified:** anything on the Flint 4 — expect a newer OpenWrt base, different `ubus`
object names and a different `gl-*` surface, so re-run discovery there. `exec` has had no
device test beyond its policy gate. Concurrency beyond one apply at a time is untested
(a second `uci_apply` is refused while one is pending).

**Known limitations**

- There is **no permanent denylist**. `sysupgrade`, `firstboot` and `mtd` are reachable if a
  policy grants them. That was a deliberate choice; keep recovery access to hand.
- A broadly scoped `exec` grant is a root shell, and from a root shell `openwrt-mcp allow`
  grants anything else. Scoped grants (`exec` limited to named binaries) keep the policy
  engine meaningful; an unscoped one reduces it to an audit trail.
- Rate-limit windows are process-scoped, so a restart resets them — erring toward allowing
  what you already granted.
- The binary doesn't survive a firmware upgrade (`/etc/config` does, `/usr/bin` doesn't).
  Re-run `make install` afterwards until it's packaged as an `.ipk`/`.apk`.
